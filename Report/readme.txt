Two files have been prepared to write the report for the Modelleringsprojekt:
- reportsam.tex
- bibsam.bib

reportsam.tex: is the file that will contain your document. Some basic commands have been introduced in order to show how to use the basic strucuture of the document

bibsam.bib: contains some entries for the database of references

The zip file contains also:
- reportsam.pdf: pdf file resulting from the included reportsam.tex
- folder Figures containing the figures for the file reportsam.tex
_______________________________________________________
How to use the files:

- extract the files from "mopr_report.zip" using the full folder path

- run "latex reportsam.tex" twice and check that the file reportsam.dvi file looks like the file reportsam.pdf
